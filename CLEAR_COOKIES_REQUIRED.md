# 🔧 JWT Session Error - FIXED

## ✅ What I Fixed

The error "no matching decryption secret" happened because you had **old session cookies** created before we set the AUTH_SECRET.

### **Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Verified AUTH_SECRET is set correctly
2. ✅ Cleared Next.js cache (.next folder)
3. ✅ Killed all Node processes
4. ✅ Restarted Next.js server with fresh state
5. ✅ Restarted ngrok tunnel

## ✅ Why This Happened

JWT tokens are encrypted with a secret key. When we first set up AUTH_SECRET, any existing session cookies were created without it or with a different secret. The server can't decrypt them, causing the error.

**Solution:** Clear old cookies so new ones can be created with the correct secret.

✅ **Database:** Connected  
✅ **Cache:** Cleared
